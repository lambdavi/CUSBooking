# About The Project

Small project born out of boredom of booking a gym at a specific time.
Currently, it is fully functional and automated using Cron on Ubuntu 18.06.
It will be further encapsulated in a setup and distributed to athletic friends and relatives.
Current features:

Selection of weekdays
Flexibility based on available bandwidth, the bot will make a reservation when the page is ready, even in case of delays.
Note: This project is a hobby, and I take no responsibility for how it will be used.
